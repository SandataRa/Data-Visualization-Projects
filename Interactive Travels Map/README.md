# Interactive Travels Map
Tracking all my completed travels in a Power BI dashboard using Flow maps. Go read my detailed blog post here: [Interactive Travels map](https://www.sandata-engineering.com/en/post/interactive-travel-map) 

For this project, the dataset is stored in my personal Google Sheet. [Download the template of the dataset here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_DrjIe15Bz7OKdCV8jE8YEg1UblWcdPVyYHUYgFfsHU/edit?usp=sharing)
