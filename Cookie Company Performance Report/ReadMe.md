# Kevin Cookie Sales Performance

This projects uses Kevin Stratvert's dataset to allow the analysis of his fictional Cookie company named Kevin Cookies Company. In this dashboard, the idea is to focus on building insightful graphics to display sales results.  

For this project, the dataset is stored in my personal Google Sheet and was directly taken from Kevin Stratvert's. [Download the original dataset here.](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=B09F9559F6A16B6C%2168800&authkey=!AIoMdcxZbck4gto)
